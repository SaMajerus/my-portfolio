## Description
This is the Landing Page that will (apparently) be used in creating my full Programming Portfolio later on. Contains a recent photo of me, a list of Epicodus projects 
that I've started/worked on (which is periodically updated), and a rather-extensive 'About Me' section. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

<!-- Do as follows ONLY when this is finished (Calvin confirmed this):  Do a git clone of the remote repo, create 'gh-pages' branch, push cloned-repo to that branch.    -SM, 8-18-2022, 9:08am. --> 
* To view the webpage via GitHub-Pages, click the following link (no malware, I promise):  <!--SaMajerus.github.io/portfolio-->
* 
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* 
* _should go here_

## License

_{Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.}_
<!--Write this part (see template's descriptor line above) based off of how I did it for the Week 2 Code-Review. (Asked Calvin when i met with him today, he agreed that how I wrote it for Wk2 was/is fine.)   -SM, 8-18-2022, 9:06am. -->
