## Description
This is the Landing Page that will (apparently) be used in creating my full Programming Portfolio later on. Contains a recent photo of me, a list of Epicodus projects 
that I've started/worked on (which is periodically updated), and a rather-extensive 'About Me' section. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

<!-- Do as follows ONLY when this is project finished (Calvin confirmed this):  Do a git clone of the remote repo, create 'gh-pages' branch, push cloned-repo to that branch.    -SM, 8-18-2022, 9:08am. --> 
* To view the webpage via GitHub-Pages, click the following link (no malware, I promise):  https://samajerus.github.io/my-portfolio/  


## Known Bugs

* Caption that accompanies my picture is missing from the page, centered in the middle of the picture but hidden, or is invisible...  
* Potential bug/result: if the CSS file is not in its proper directory, then not only will formatting and styling be missing, but my picture will be huge -- literally. 
* Indentation of the section 'Activities I enjoy' is intentional. (Not a bug) 
* I intended to add a box around the 'Epicodus Projects List', but it didn't show up on the page when I tested it (possibly due to proximity of the Box Model for the 'About Me' section). That is why any code related to it is commented out in both the HTML- and CSS-files.
