## Description
This is the Landing Page that will (apparently) be used in creating my full Programming Portfolio later on. Contains a recent photo of me, a list of Epicodus projects 
that I've started/worked on (which is periodically updated), and a rather-extensive 'About Me' section. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

<!-- Do as follows ONLY when this is project finished (Calvin confirmed this):  Do a git clone of the remote repo, create 'gh-pages' branch, push cloned-repo to that branch.    -SM, 8-18-2022, 9:08am. --> 
* To view the webpage via GitHub-Pages, click the following link (no malware, I promise):  <!--SaMajerus.github.io/portfolio--> 


_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* Caption that accompanies my picture is missing from the page, centered in the middle of the picture but hidden, or is invisible...  
* Descriptions of each Epicodus project in the list are supposed to be 8pt-size. 
* Potential bug/result: if the CSS file is not in its proper directory, then not only will formatting and styling be missing, but my picture will be huge -- literally. 

## License

<!--Write this part (see template's descriptor line above) based off of how I did it for the Week 2 Code-Review. (Asked Calvin when i met with him today, he agreed that how I wrote it for Wk2 was/is fine.)   -SM, 8-18-2022, 9:06am. --> 
Email me at ladolego@gmail.com for questions, ideas, concerns, or even any issues that you run into.  You may also clone or Fork the content in this Repo to fiddle around with it on your own, if you like. Trying to fiddle with the repo itself, however, is off-limits.
