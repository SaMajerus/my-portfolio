# Portfolio Landing Page

#### By Sam Majerus 

#### My portfolio landing page. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Markdown
* GitHub (Remote repository, GitHub-Pages) 

## Description
This is the Landing Page that will (apparently) be used in creating my full Programming Portfolio later on. Contains a recent photo of me, a list of Epicodus projects 
that I've started/worked on (which is periodically updated), and a dedicated 'About Me' section. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* To view the webpage via GitHub-Pages, click the following link (no malware, I promise):  SaMajerus.github.io/portfolio.
* xx
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* Photo of myself won't display, because '.HEIC' is unsupported by HTML or something else. (Caption is unaffected, apart from the 
missing photo icon.)
* _should go here_

## License

_{Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.}_
